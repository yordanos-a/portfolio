								Hi! My name is Yordanos Ayelework. I am currently a senior doing my Bachelor's of Science at McMurry University. I major in Computer Science and minor in Mathematics and Religion. I work as a Math and Computer Science tutor, as well as the Supplemental Instructor for Programming Fundamentals. Additionally, I am the president for the WarHawk Coders Club.</p>
								<p style="text-align:justify;">
								I'm interested in software engineering and web development. My interests include front-end and back-end development and working on collaborative projects to solve real world problems.
							</p>
							<p>
								 Outside of Computer Science, my hobbies include books, art, music, and engaging in social gatherings. I love getting to know people and creating new meaningful connections.
